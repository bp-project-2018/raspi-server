# IoT-sys-net-bp raspi server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iot-bp-project-2018/raspi-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iot-bp-project-2018/raspi-server)

We build a prototype of an IoT / Cyber-Physical system-of-systems network.

This is the server for the Raspberry Pi collecting the data.

The main executable is provided by the package in `/cmd/server`.

The communication protocol is documented in [`/doc/Protocol.md.html`](https://raw.githack.com/iot-bp-project-2018/raspi-server/master/doc/Protocol.md.html).

Some example network configurations are provided in [`/cmd/examples`](cmd/examples).

Instructions on how to use the Server/ Webinterface are available in the [User Guide](doc/User-Guide.pdf)
